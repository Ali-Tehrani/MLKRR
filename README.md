# Metric Learning for Kernel Ridge Regression (MLKRR)


This repository contains the a python module with the code to execute the MLKRR algorithm. The provided `MLKRR` class has a similar API to standard `scikit-learn` regressors and uses a fit method.

Dependencies are minimal:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`

It also includes two tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks with an introduction to similarity-based machine learning (`1-Introduction.ipynb`) and a demonstration on how to use MLKRR (`2-Kernel_regression%2C_MLKR_and_MLKRR.ipynb`).
